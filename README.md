# OTA
npm install 

and run "npm run dev"

You can run the endpoints through postman, 
the url will be "http://localhost:8080"

As per instruction, there will be endpoints for: 
1. GET /notes 
2. GET /notes/:id
3. POST /notes
4. PUT /notes/:id
5. DELETE /notes/:id

I have json file for storing, creating, updating and deleting notes. 
It is located at /data folder, there is a notes.json file where you can check and verify if the data is correctly being stored, etc.
